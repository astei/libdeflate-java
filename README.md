# libdeflate-java

This project provides safe, high-performance JNI bindings to the [libdeflate](https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate)
library. This project grew out of an effort to improve compression performance in the _Minecraft: Java Edition_
protocol for my Minecraft proxy [Velocity](https://github.com/VelocityPowered/Velocity), but I have endeavoured to
make this library as generally useful as possible by providing a faithful Java representation of the entire
libdeflate library.

## Depending on this library

**Note**: As of September 28, 2020, I have yet to publish the library... I am working on finishing basic functionality.

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>me.steinborn</groupId>
    <artifactId>libdeflate-java-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

For Netty extensions:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>me.steinborn</groupId>
    <artifactId>libdeflate-java-netty</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("me.steinborn:libdeflate-java-core:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

For Netty extensions:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("me.steinborn:libdeflate-java-netty:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

## Why use libdeflate over `java.util.zip`?

There are very good reasons to consider libdeflate over the `java.util.zip` bindings to zlib:

* libdeflate has significantly improved performance over any zlib variant available, often 2x as
  fast as zlib.
* Prior to Java 11, there was no API for `ByteBuffer`. This library includes a `ByteBuffer` API.

There are, of course, downsides:

* libdeflate does not support a streaming API yet. Should a streaming API be added to `libdeflate` we will add support for it.
* libdeflate is only optimized for x86, x86_64 and aarch64. This should be sufficient for the vast majority of users, and there
  are generic routines in case your platform does not have an optimized routine.
* Some JVMs may choose to intrinsicify certain `java.util.zip` APIs. In general, the deflate and inflate implementations are
  not intrinsified, whereas CRC32 computations are. We must hook into libdeflate through JNI, which does introduce some
  overhead. It is hoped that projects like [Project Panama](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/panama/) will reduce this overhead
  and eliminate the requirement to use JNI except to support backwards compatibility. (In other words, the final state of this
  project is to wrap the regular libdeflate library directly without marshalling across the JNI layer.)

## Compatibility

Currently these bindings are well-supported only on x86_64 Linux as that is my primary development platform.
I will add support for other platforms as time and demand permits. Contributions welcome!

### Supported platforms

* Linux x86_64
* Windows x86_64

### Planned support

* macOS x86_64
* macOS aarch64
* Linux aarch64

## Building

### Linux

You will need:

* a basic C toolchain
* GNU make
* a JDK

Make sure `JAVA_HOME` is defined and build this project as usual for a Gradle project. I have looked at options
for building native modules with Gradle, and unfortunately dropping down to GNU Make has wound up being the most sane
solution.

### Windows

Slightly different needs here. On Windows, this library builds using the Microsoft toolchain:

* Visual Studio build tools for C/C++. Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise and Visual Studio 2019 Community are known to
  work.
* `vswhere` (this can be installed using Chocolatey with `choco install vswhere`)

## API usage

The API revolves around two classes, `me.steinborn.libdeflate.LibdeflateCompressor` and `me.steinborn.libdeflate.LibdeflateDecompressor`.
When instantiated, a native libdeflate peer object is created. Once you are done with the (de)compressor you are expected
to call `close()` on the object, which will invalidate the Java object and free the native libdeflate object.

All APIs support working on byte arrays (`byte[]`) with arbitrary position and lengths and `ByteBuffer` instances,
whether they are direct or heap buffers. You will most likely prefer to work with the `ByteBuffer` API as it is much
cleaner.

In addition, `me.steinborn.libdeflate.LibdeflateAdler32` provides a drop-in replacement for `java.util.zip.Adler32`
and `me.steinborn.libdeflate.LibdeflateCRC32` is a drop-in replacement for `java.util.zip.CRC32`. As with the
rest of the library, the Adler-32 and CRC32 implementations are well-optimized code that uses native hardware vector operations.

### Netty extensions

This library also provides an artifact that adds selected `libdeflate` functions that deal with Netty
`ByteBuf`s, specifically `LibdeflateNettyCompressor` and `LibdeflateNettyDecompressor`. This support works best with
contiguous, direct `ByteBuf` instances.
